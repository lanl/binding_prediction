# Binding Enthalpy Machine Learning Model
This is a trained Gradient-Boosting Trees model and accompanying python script from our paper "Design of Amine-Functionalized Materials for Direct Air Capture Using Integrated High-Throughput Calculations and Machine Learning" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13982)


## Running the model

### 1. Clone the repository 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lanl/binding_prediction.git
cd binding_prediction/binding_prediction
```

### 2. Set up the conda environment

```bash
conda create -n bind_pred -c conda-forge rdkit mordred numpy=1.23 scikit-learn=1.3.0
conda activate bind_pred
pip install rdchiral
```

### 3. Run the model

```bash
python run_model.py smiles.txt
```

This will print a list of binding enthalpies for each SMILES in "smiles.txt" with the following format, one per line:

\<parent SMILES\>,\<child SMILES\>,\<binding enthalpy\>

If a SMILES has multiple binding sites (as described in the paper) then there will be a line for each unique child.


"smiles.txt" is provided as a small test case. Replace with your own text file (one SMILES per line) to run the model on other molecules.
